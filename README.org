* op-ui
op-ui is going to a be a simple gui for access 1Password on linux.  It will
be a wrapper around the 1Password cli (op) with a simple gui.

* TODO
  - [ ] Finish wrapping all op commands using the OnePassword class
    - [ ] list events - requires custom function or maybe extended on
  - [ ] Implement the GUI
  - [ ] Maybe organize the project a bit better
  - [ ] Probably a whole lot more...
